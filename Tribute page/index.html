        <h3><b><mark><u>Mahabharat:</u></mark></b></h3>
    </p>
    <P>The <em><b>Mahabharata</b></em> is an ancient Indian epic where the main story revolves around two branches of a family - the <mark>Pandavas</mark> and <mark>Kauravas</mark> - who, in the <mark>Kurukshetra War</mark> , battle for the throne of Hastinapura.
       Interwoven into this narrative are several smaller stories about people dead or living, and philosophical discourses.
       <mark>Krishna</mark>-Dwaipayan Vyasa, himself a character in the epic, composed it; as, according to tradition, he dictated the verses and <mark>Ganesha</mark> wrote them down. 
       At 100,000 verses, it is the longest epic poem ever written, generally thought to have been composed in the 4th century BCE or earlier. 
       The events in the epic play out in the Indian subcontinent and surrounding areas. 
       It was first narrated by a student of Vyasa at a snake-sacrifice of the great-grandson of one of the major characters of the story. 
       Including within it the <mark>Bhagavad Gita</mark>, the Mahabharata is one of the most important texts of<mark> ancient Indian, indeed world, literature</mark>.</P><br>
