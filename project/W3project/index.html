    <h2>About The World Wide Web</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web (known as "WWW', "Web" or "W3") is the universe of network-accessible information, the embodiment of human knowledge.

        The World Wide Web began as a networked information project at<a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a>, where Tim Berners-Lee, now Director of the World Wide Web Consortium [W3C], developed a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Summary.html">vision</a> of the project.
        
        The Web has a body of software, and a set of protocols and conventions. Through the use hypertext and multimedia techniques, the web is easy for anyone to roam, browse, and contribute to. An early <a href="https://www.w3.org/Talks/General.html">talk</a> about the Web gives some more background on how the Web was originally conceived.</p>
